# AirBnB_clone
The goal of the project is to build a clone of the Airbnb website from scratch.

The project is divided into several parts, each of which focuses on a different aspect of web development. For example, one part of the project involves creating the frontend of the website using HTML and CSS. Another part of the project involves creating the backend of the website using Python and MySQL.

The Airbnb Holberton project is a challenging project, but it is also a great way for students to learn about web development and to build a real-world application.

Here is a more detailed overview of the different parts of the Airbnb project:

- Console: The console is a command line interface that allows students to interact with the backend of the application. For example, students can use the console to create and manage user accounts, listings, and reservations.
- Web static: The web static part of the project involves creating the static frontend of the website using HTML and CSS. This includes creating the layout of the website, the navigation bar, and the different pages, such as the homepage, the listing search page, and the listing detail page.
- MySQL: The MySQL part of the project involves creating a database to store the data for the application, such as user accounts, listings, and reservations. Students will also need to write SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate the data in the database.
- Deploy static: The deploy static part of the project involves deploying the static frontend of the website to a web server. This allows students to share their website with others so that they can view it and test it.
- Web framework: The web framework part of the project involves using a web framework to create the dynamic backend of the website. This allows students to create features such as user authentication, search functionality, and booking functionality.
- RESTful API: The RESTful API part of the project involves creating a RESTful API to allow other applications to interact with the Airbnb Holberton website. This allows students to integrate their website with other services, such as payment processors and mapping services.
- Web dynamic: The web dynamic part of the project involves using the web framework to create the dynamic frontend of the website. This allows students to create features such as live search results, real-time updates to listings, and user profiles.
